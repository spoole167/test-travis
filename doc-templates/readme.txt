Example json documents for the various formats of couchdb documents

team-template.json  shows the top level document for the main summary server. This is not required for product team servers.


Note the url field that is expected to point to a server that will return a json formatted response that is an array of product-template entries

The actual products served by the team server are held in a document similar to product-list-template.json
